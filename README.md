## Instructions

1. Open the Start menu and type `shell:startup` in the Run dialog to open the Startup folder.
2. Copy and paste both scripts (`startup_programs.bat` and `window_positioning.ps1`) into the Startup folder.
3. When the scripts run, `program1` will occupy 70% of the screen width, and `program2` will occupy the remaining 30%.
4. Ensure that the `processName` variable in the scripts matches the exact window name of each program.

### Important Notes

- The `startup_programs.bat` script is responsible for launching the programs. Ensure you update the paths to the executable files.
- To easily copy the path of a program, hold `Shift`, right-click on the program file, and select the `Copy as path` option.
